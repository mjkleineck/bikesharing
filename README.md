## Summary
The data from the Citi bikesharing system shows that riders commonly ride the bikes to commute during the weekdays and to sightsee outside of the morning and evening rush hours. New York City is an ideal location for bikesharing due to its high population density, its wide array of historical and tourist attractions, and its need for additional methods of transit. To further examine the data around the usertypes (subscriber and customer) to better understand how the use of the system differs, it's recommended to create visualizations based on usertypes, trip duration, and day/hour or trip. This data would be helpful in determining if the trips are for commuting or sightseeing. Further, it would be recommended to visualize start and end locations at particular times of the day and week by customers and subscribers. This would also help determine the purpose of riders' trips.
